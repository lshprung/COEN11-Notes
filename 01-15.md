# Review Pointers

Below is an example to demonstrate pointer precedence:

```
int x[] = {0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...};
int y = 5;
int *p = x;

y = ++*p
printf("%d, %d\n", y, *p);
y = *(++p);
printf(...); //ditto
y = ++(*p);
printf(...); //ditto
```

The code outputs the following:

```
1, 1
5, 5
6, 6
```

# Introduction to Structures in C

-`Earlier we talked about data types: int, char
- A Structure allows for multiple data types in one array
- Structure Basics
	- A structure is a collection of values, called members

- Outline of Structure Definition:

```
struct name{
	variable declaration;
	variable declaration;
	...
};
```

- Example:

```
struct info{
	int number;
	char character;
	char string[10];
	int array[10];
};
```

- Let's see the memory:

|   |   |
| - | - |
|   |   |
| Real_Info  | 55 bytes of storage |
|   |   |

- You can also create pointers to data structures

- Defines a structure type

---

- Another Example:

```
struct node{
	int number;
	struct node *link;
};
```
