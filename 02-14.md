# Arguments for main()

To add arguments to main, do something like this:

```
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
```

- `int argc` is the number of arguments
	- the name (`a.out`) is an argument, so there will always be at least one argument
- `char *argv[]` is an array of strings, where each is an argument for the program
- example, if you want two arguments, check that argc is the correct value: `argc == 3` (since you need one for the execution)

# Recursion (not on Midterm #2)

- A recursive function calls itself or is part of a cycle in the sequence of function calls
	- Allows for the possibility for a function call to be repeated with different parameters

- Alternative to iteration
	- less efficient
	- more simple

- You will never use a loop ina recursive function
	- recursion is meant to substitute the use of loops

- Problems that lend themselves to a Recursive Solution:
	- simple cases with a a straightforward solution
	- cases can be redefined to be simplified
	- redefinition process can reduce complex problems to simple cases (relatively easy to solve)

General form:

```
if this is a **simple case**
	solve it
else
	**redefine** the problem using recursion
```

Example: we want to multiply 6 by 3, but we only know how to add, and that x \* 1 = x

```
int multiply(int m, int n){
	int ans;

	if(n == 1) ans = m;
	else ans = m + multiply(m, n-1);
	return(ans);
}
```

- Recursion can be useful for processing varying-length lists
	- Strings
	- Linked-lists
	- Etc.

Example: write a function to count the number of times a particular character appears in a string

```
int count(char ch, char *str){

	if(*str == '\0') return 0;
	if(ch == *str) return(1 + count(ch, str+1));
	else return(count(ch, str+1));

}
```

## Traversing Recursive Functions

- *Hand Tracing* can be used to better understand how recursion works
	- going through function calls step-by-step

- Parameters and Local Variable Stacks
	- Local function values are kept in a *stack*
	- A *stack* is a data structure
		- last data item in is first data item out
	- *system stack* is an area in memory where parameters and local variables are
		- allocated when a function is called
		- deallocated (freed) when the function returns
	- When a program is executing:
		- Calling a function "pushes" its local values onto the top of the stack
		- Returning from a function "pops" its local values from the top of the stack

## Math Function and Recursion

- Many mathematical functions are defined recursively

- Example: Factorial
	- 0! = 1
	- n! = n \* (n-1)! for n>0
- As a function:

```
int factorial(int n){
	int ans;

	if(n == 0) ans = 1;
	else ans = n * factorial(n-1);

	return(ans);
}
```

- Example: The Fibonacci Sequence ([Spiral Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7JG63IuaWs))

```
int fibonacci(int n){
	int ans;

	if(n == 0 || n == 1) ans = n;
	else ans = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);

	return ans;
}
```
