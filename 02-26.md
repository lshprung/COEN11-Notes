# Threading Continued

## Locking

- Sharing Variables
	- Requires mutual exclusion
	- Lock/unlock to avoid a race condition
- Have one lock for each independent critical region

- Bad Example (no synchronization):

```
int count = 0;

void *update(){ //returns a pointer with no given data type
	int i;

	for(i = 0; i < 1000; i++){
		count++;
	}
}
```

- Good Example (using lock):

```
int count = 0;

void *update(){ //returns a pointer with no given data type
	int i;

	for(i = 0; i < 1000; i++){
		//lock
		count++;
		//unlock
	}
}
```

- More real world example:

```
int balance = 100; //$100

//process 1: withdraw $20
	//read balance (i.e $100)
	//write new balance (i.e $80)

//process 2: withdraw $30
	//read balance (i.e $80)
	//write new balance (i.e $50)
```

- In the above example, you need to use lock to avoid one process reading the balance before the other process finishes writing

## pthread library

- We will use the Linux pthread library
	- Main information
		- `man pthread`
	- There are man pages for specific functions
	- Include ".h" file as shown in the man page: `#include <pthread.h>`
	- Compile using `-lpthread`

- Operations:

```
#include <pthread.h>

pthread_t thread;

int pthread_create(
	pthread_t *restrict thread,          //thread id
	const pthread_attr_t *restrict attr, //attributes
	void *(*start_routine)(void *),      //function
	void *restrict arg);                 //argument
```

- More operations:
	- `void pthread_exit(void *value_ptr);`
	- `int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **value_ptr);`

- Example using pthreads
	- Alternating threads
		- Creates 3 threads
		- Let the system execute them in a round-robin fashion
		- Wait for them to finish at main

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h> //this is the library that allows for threading

void *loopThread(void *arg);

int main(){
	int i;
	pthread_t thr[3];

	for(i = 0; i < 3; i++){
		pthread_create(&thr[i], NULL, loopThread, (void *)i);
	}
	for(i = 0; i < 3; i++){
		pthread_join(thr[i], NULL);
	}
}

void *loopThread(void *arg){
	int i, j;
	int threadNo = (int)arg; //cast the void pointer

	for(i = 0; i < 20; i++){
		printf("Thread %d\n", threadNo);
		sleep(1);
	}
}
```

- Functions:

```
pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER

//INIT
int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *restrict mutex, const pthread_mutexattr_t *restrict attr);

//LOCK
int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);

//UNLOCK
int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
```

- Example using mutex lock:

```
//Using mutex lock
//pthread_mutex_init called in main

int count = 0; 
pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void *update(){
	int i;

	while(i = 0; i < 1000; i++){
		pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
		count++;
		pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
	}
}
```

- Danger!
	- When one or more threads are waiting for one another and no thread can proceed
- Example:
	- One thread is waiting for itself
	- Two threads are waiting for each other
	- Several threads are waiting for one another in a cycle

## Performance Considerations

- Thread creation is expensive
- Each thread has its own stack
- Lock contention requires skills to keep many threads as possible running
