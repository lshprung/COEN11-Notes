# Large Programs

- When programs are long
	- Need to split the file into several files
	- Need to compile them together
	- Example:
		- We have files: main.c, list.c, file.c
		- To compile: `gcc -o proj main.c list.c file.c`

- Sharing global variables
	- Define types in a `.h` file
	- Declare global variables (do not initialize!)
		- extern in a .h file
	- Declare and initialize global variables
		- in one of the .c file (e.g., the main one)
	- Include the .h file in all the .c files which use any of the global variables: `#include "proj.h"`

- Example:
	- in `link.h`, declare (do not initialize!) global variables
		- `extern NODE *head;`
	- In main.c, include link.h, and declare and initialize global variables

```
#include "link.h"
NODE *head = (NODE *)NULL;
```

- In all the other .c files, just include link.h
	- `#include "link.h"`

- Use `makefile` to automate the compilation process
- Create a "makefile" file with instructions
- Command `make` will parse the makefile file and execute the appropraite command
	- `<prompt> make proj1`

- Example 1:

```
proj1: main1.c list1.c io1.c
	gcc -o proj1 main1.c list1.c io1.c
	./proj1 filename
```

- Example 2:

```
proj2: main2.c list2.c thr2.c
	gcc -o proj2 main2.c list2.c thr2.c -lpthread
	./proj2 filename1 filename2
```

- The tab is important! (its the syntax)

## Development Tools

- Unix/Linux
	- Environment and commands
	- Tools - learn to use these!!
		- vi
		- grep
		- gdb
		- makefile
		- shell script

- Libraries

	- String
	- Memory
	- Threads

# Special Operators

## Condtional Operator

- The conditional operator `?:` takes three operands
	- c ? r1 : r2
	- The value of the expression using the conditional operator is the value of either its second or third operand, depending on the value of the first operand
	- Shorthand for:

```
if(c){
	//result value is r1
}
else{
	//result value is r2
}
```

- Examples
	- In assignment: `x = (a < b) ? a : b;`
		- x will be assigned the smallest value between a and b

- Very useful for macros
- Examples:
	- `#define MAX(a,b) (((a) > (b)) ? (a) : (b))`
		- returns the max between the paramaters assigned to a and b
	- `define ISLETTER(c) (((c) >= 'A' && (c) <= 'z') ? 1 : 0)`
		- returns 1 if the value of assigned to c is a letter and returns 0 if not

## Sequential Evaluation

- The comma operator
	- Evaluates its two operands in sequence, yeilding the value of the second operand as the value of the expression
	- The value of the first is discarded

- Example:
	- In assignments: `x = (i += 2, a[i]);` -> `i += 2; x = a[i];`
		- Parenthesis are important because precedence 

## Bitwise Operators

- Positive integers are represented in the computer by standard binary numbers
	- Examples:
		
```
short n = 13;
//in memory - 0000 0000 0000 1101
//2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 13

char c = 5;
//in memory - 0000 0101
//2^0 + 2^2 = 5
```

- Bitwise operators
	- take operands of any integer type
		- char, short, int, long
	- but treat an operand as a collection of bits rather than a single number

### Bitwise Negation

- Bitwise negation
	- Operand: `~`
		- Application of `~` to an integer produces a value in which each bit of the operand has been replaced by its negation
			- 0 -> 1
			- 1 -> 0
		- Example:
			- ` n = 0000 0000 0000 1101`
			- `~n = 1111 1111 1111 0010`

### Bitwise Shift

- Shift operators
	- shift left: `<<`
	- shift right: `>>`
	- Take two integers operands
		- The value on the left is the number to be shifted
			- Viewed as a collection of bits that can move
			- To avoid implementation problems, avoid negative numbers when shifting right
		- The value on the right is a nonnegative number telling how far to move the bits

- Operand
	- `<<` shifts bits left
	- `>>` shifts bits right
- The bits that "fall off the end" are lost
- The "emptied" positions are filled with zeros

- Examples:
	
```
int n; //    n is 0000 0000 0000 1101
n << 1 //now n is 0000 0000 0001 1010
n << 4 //now n is 0000 0000 1101 0000
n >> 3 //now n is 0000 0000 0000 0001
```

- Compound assignment operators `<<=` and `>>=`
	- cause the value resulting from the shift to be stored in the variable supplied as the left operand

### Bitwise AND, XOR, and OR

- The bitwise operators `&` (and), `^` (xor), and `|` (or)
	- Take two operands that are viewed as strings of bits
	- The operator determines each bit of the result by considering corresponding bits of each operand
	- For each bit:
		- `r = n & m` -> 1 when both n and m are 1
		- `r = n | m` -> 1 when n and/or m is 1
		- `r = n ^ m` -> 1 when n and m do not match

- Example:

```
n =     0000 0000 0000 1101
m =     0000 0000 0011 1100
m & n = 0000 0000 0000 1100

n =     0000 0000 0000 1101
m =     0000 0000 0011 1100
m | n = 0000 0000 0011 1101

n =     0000 0000 0000 1101
m =     0000 0000 0011 1100
m ^ n = 0000 0000 0011 0001
```

- Compound assignment operators `&=`, `|=`, `^=`
	- cause the resulting value to be stored in the variable supplied as the left operand

---

- Notes on shifting
	- `<<` by 1 is the same as multiplying by 2
	- `>>` by 1 is the same as dividing by 2
- Notes on `~` and `!`
	- `~` and `!` are different operators
		- `~` is a bitwise operator
			- each bit is reversed
		- `!` is a logical complement or negation
			- `!nonzero` -> false (zero)
			- `!zero` -> true (one)

- Notes on AND
	- `x & 0` is always 0
	- `x & 1` is always x
- Notes on OR
	- `x | 1` is always 1
	- `x | 0` is always x

- Masks -- Used to change specific bits in an integer
	- To set specific bits
		- Use OR with a mask in which only the bits to be set have 1:

```
short c =    0000 0101
short mask = 0000 0010
c | mask =   0000 0111
```

- To zero specific bits
	- Use AND with a mask in which only the bits to be zeroed have 0

```
short c =    0000 0101
short mask = 1111 1110
c & mask =   0000 0100
```

- To verify specific bit
	- Use AND with a mask in which only the bit to be verified is 1
	- Result == 0 implied that bit == 0
	- Result != 0 implies that bit == 1

```
short c =    0000 0101
short mask = 0000 0100
c & mask =   0000 0100 //not zero ==> bit is not zero
```

- Notes on XOR
	- x ^ 0 is always x
	- x ^ 1 is always ~x
	- x ^ x is always 0
	- x ^ ~x is always 1
	- x ^ y == z, then
		- x == z ^ y and y == z ^ x
